== Changes to ECMAScript, Part 2: Harmony Highlights - proxies and traits ==

Speaker: Tom Van Cutsem
Google, Mountain View, April 20, 2010

=== Abstract ===

We discuss two proposed language features for inclusion in ECMAScript-Harmony. The first, dynamic proxies, enables Javascript programmers to create proxy objects that can intercept property access, assignment, enumeration, etc. It is a powerful metaprogramming mechanism that provides a standard API for creating generic wrappers for transparent access control, implementing legacy API adaptors, profilers, lazy initialization, etc.

The second part of the talk introduces a traits library for ECMAScript 5. Traits are a more robust alternative to multiple inheritance or mixin-based composition. Based on ECMAScript 5's new "property descriptor" API, we built a portable lightweight library that supports trait-based object composition. We discuss the limitations of introducing traits using a library approach and highlight the benefits of direct support for traits in ECMAScript-Harmony.
